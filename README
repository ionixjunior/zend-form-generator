This is a library to create Zend Forms automatically based on information from the database.

Requirements for the usage:
PHP 5 >= 5.3.0

The forms files are created based on tables existing in the database, so for each table that exists in the database a form file will be created.

To created the form files correctly each column of table must contain a comment labeling the field, this comment will be used in the field element of the form file being generated.

At the moment of the creation of each field in the form file, some validations are considered. If the field type is string, the attribute maxlength is inserted on Zend Form Element. If the field type is integer, the Zend_Validate_Int is inserted in the Zend Form Element. If the field deny null values on column, the validator Zend_Validate_NotEmpty and option required will be inserted in the form element. 

On each columns of tables on database, if the column exist a foreign key, automatically the form element inserted will be Zend_Form_Element_Select.

You can create the forms files the following ways:
- In the pattern suggested by Zend ( verify Zend manual section recommended structure )
- In your personal library ( using namespaces ) 



1) The database:

To generate the forms, you can use database MySQL or PostgreSQL. Configure your database file zend-form-generator.php and enjoy the library.

There are two test databases that you can check the files and "database-mysql.sql" and "database-postgresql.sql".

Remember, you need to insert a comment in all the columns of the database to the form generator function properly.



2) Run the library:

To generate your forms, just execute the following commands:

Generating forms inside the Forms folder using structure recommended by Zend:
$ php zend-form-generator.php generate-forms Forms


Generating forms inside the Forms folder using namespaces:
$ php zend-form-generator.php generate-forms Forms Name\Your\Namespace


Generating forms inside the Forms folder including the primary keys of tables.
$ php zend-form-generator.php generate-forms --primary-keys Forms
or
$ php zend-form-generator.php generate-forms --primary-keys Forms Name\Your\Namespace


Soon a feature to customize the forms using decorators will be added.

Enjoy!
